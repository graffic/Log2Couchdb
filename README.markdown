Introduction
============

This project tries to implement a way of storing log entries in couchdb via udp.

It was created from the need of a unified way to view extended logs of a web
application running in multiple webservers.

Why udp?
--------
Because it's cheap for logging.

Why couchdb?
------------
Love the map reduce indexes. Still I have to test this with mongodb.
